# Notetaking App


This is a minimalist python note taking app.

Goal: Create a minimal note taking app for use on my local machines for when I need to quickly jot something down.

Features: 

Store notes (default opens to new note)
* Notes are stored in a /data folder in the directly of this project
* Notes are saved in folders by date
* Names are incremented by 1
    * Eventually I might add named files
Supports markdown rendering features
* Lists (use * )
* Bold (planned)
* Title (planned)

Non Markdown (Planned feature)
    
* Planning to use alt to reorder text


    example: Inline math *MATH* 20 * 20 
    would resolve to 20 * 20 = 400



## Running


### Notes: 
Does not use any not default packages
### Requirements:
Python 3.9+


## Instructions:
python main.py

or via .bat file

this uses pythonw.exe instead of python in order to hide the console window
if you create a shortcut and apply a keybinding it will open from anywhere
